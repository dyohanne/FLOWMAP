\arguments{
\item{mode}{FLOWMAPR mode to use in analysis based on starting input,
available options include \code{c("single", "multi", "one", "static-multi")}}

\item{df}{single dataframe, list of dataframes with each member belonging to single-cell
data from a different timepoint, or a list of lists of dataframes belonging to the same timepoint,
but coming from different conditions, to be used in analysis}

\item{project.name}{Character string to label file output of FLOWMAPR analysis}

\item{clustering.var}{Vector naming channels to be used to calculate distances/differences
between cells for clustering (if requested) and edge-drawing steps}

\item{distance.metric}{Character specifying which metric to use to calculate between-node distances, valid options include \code{c("manhattan", "euclidean")}}

\item{minimum}{Numeric value specifying the minimum number of edges that will be allotted
during each density-dependent edge-building step of the FLOW-MAP graph, default value is
set to \code{2}, no less than 2 is recommended}

\item{maximum}{Numeric value specifying the maximum number of edges that will be allotted
during each density-dependent edge-building step of the FLOW-MAP graph, default value is
set to \code{5}, no less than 3 is recommended}

\item{save.folder}{Directory where all results generated should be saved}

\item{time.col.label}{Character specifying the name of the channel with the time labels for each cell}

\item{condition.col.label}{Character specifying the name of the channel with the condition labels for each cell}

\item{name.sort}{Logical specifying whether to sort FCS file path names alphanumerically or use
them in the order supplied by the user}

\item{clustering}{Logical specifying whether to cluster single-cell data}

\item{seed.X}{Numeric value for the seed to set for reproducible FLOWMAPR runs}

\item{graph.out}{TBD}

\item{savePDFs}{Logical specifying whether to generate PDFs for the resolved graph with
nodes colored by each parameter}

\item{which.palette}{Optional variable, character specifying which color palette to use
in generated PDFs, valid options include \code{c("bluered", "jet", "CB")}, where \code{"CB"}
is a colorblind-friendly option}

\item{cluster.numbers}{Optional variable, single numeric or a vector of numerics specifying
how many clusters to generate from each separate dataframe}

\item{cluster.mode}{Character specifying which clustering algorithm to use, valid options include \code{c("hclust", "kmeans")}}

\item{k}{}

\item{umap.n.neighbors}{TBD}

\item{umap.n.components}{TBD}

\item{out_folder_basename}{= NA by default, provide string base name is desired}
}
\value{

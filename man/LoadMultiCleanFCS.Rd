\usage{
LoadMultiCleanFCS(
  list.of.file.names,
  channel.remove,
  channel.annotate,
  subsamples = 1000,
  transform = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{list.of.file.names}{A list where each member contains a vector of full file paths
to the FCS files to be used}

\item{channel.remove}{Vector naming channels to be removed from all loaded FCS data}

\item{channel.annotate}{List mapping channel names to user-specified names to properly
annotate all FCS file data}

\item{subsamples}{Numeric or vector of numerics specifying how many cells to sample
from each FCS file, default is set to \code{1000}}

\item{transform}{Logical specifying whether to transform the data using an Asinh
transform typical of CyTOF/mass cytometry datasets, default is set to \code{TRUE}}
}
\value{
a list where each member is a list containing multiple dataframes containing
single-cell data from the same timepoint, but multiple conditions
}
\description{
\code{LoadMultiCleanFCS} returns a list of FCS file data, where each member is
a list that contains dataframe from different conditions from different timepoints.
}
\examples{
list.of.file.names <- list("1" = c("Desktop/A-1.fcs", "Desktop/B-1.fcs"),

var.remove <- c("Channel3", "Channel4")
var.annotate <- list("c1" = "Channel1", "c2" = "Channel2",
"c3" = "Channel3", "c4" = "Channel4")
